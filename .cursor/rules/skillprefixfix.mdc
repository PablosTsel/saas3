 Problem:
Template 3 was displaying all skills with a "</>" prefix before each skill name (e.g., "</>Python", "</>Excel", etc.). This made the skills section look inconsistent with the intended design.

How it was fixed:
After examining the code in route.ts, we found that template 3 didn't have specific formatting for skills. It was using the default skill formatting with FontAwesome icons that rendered as "</>" prefixes. We added template-specific code for template 3 that generates skills HTML without the icon prefix.

The fix was implemented by adding specific code for template 3's skills formatting:
skillsHtml = portfolioData.skills.map((skill: Skill) => `
  <div class="skill-tag">${skill.name || ''}</div>
`).join('');

This ensures skills in template 3 now display correctly without any unnecessary prefixes.
