 # Display Size Inconsistencies

## Problem
Computer display sizes in templates (especially template2) were too small at 40% width, causing visual issues.

## Details
Display elements that represent computer screens, mobile devices, or other visual containers need to maintain appropriate proportions. Incorrect sizing can lead to visual problems and misalignment with related elements.

## Example
Project cards with computer displays appeared too small at 40% width and descriptions did not align properly with the display width.

## Solution
- Maintain proportional sizing (50% was the right compromise between too large and too small)
- Ensure that related elements (like description boxes) maintain consistent widths with their parent elements
- Test display sizes across various screen resolutions to ensure they look good at all sizes
- When adjusting sizes, consider the impact on both the display element and its surrounding content
- Use relative units (%, em, rem) rather than fixed pixel values when appropriate to allow for responsive sizing
