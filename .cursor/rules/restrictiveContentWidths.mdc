# Restrictive Content Widths

## Problem
Fixed width constraints on content elements limited text display inappropriately.

## Details
Using fixed width constraints (like max-width with specific pixel values) can create problems when content is larger than expected. This can lead to text being cut off, overflowing its container, or displaying poorly on different screen sizes.

## Example
Bio text in the About Me section was limited to `max-width: 500px` which was too restrictive for longer content and didn't adapt well to different screen sizes.

## Solution
- Use relative units and flexible sizing where appropriate
- Add proper text wrapping styles (`overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word;`)
- Test content containers with various text lengths
- Consider responsive approaches instead of fixed widths
- Use percentage-based widths with reasonable min/max constraints
- Set container widths relative to their parent elements, not fixed pixel values
- Test with actual content of varying lengths, not just placeholder text
