**Problem:** Different templates may have overlapping code sections with conditional logic that can cause unexpected overrides.

**Example:** In our case, template2's laptop-style project cards were being overridden by a generic "else" clause at the end of the file which applied a different style.

**Solution:** 
- Always check for existing template-specific code before adding new template implementations
- Use explicit conditionals like `if (templateId === 'template2')` instead of catch-all `else` blocks
- Add exclusion conditions: `else if (templateId !== 'template2')` when using fall-back code
